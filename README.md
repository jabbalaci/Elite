Elite Planet Name Generator
===========================

I found the original pytxtelite (written by Ian Sparks) at
<http://automaticromantic.com/static/misc/pytxtelite.txt>.
You can find a copy of the original script in the "pytxtelite" folder.

pytxtelite is a conversion of Ian Bell's txtelite.c 1.2 (and parts of 1.4)
to Python (2.5, maybe earlier).

As I was interested in planet names only, I removed everything
else. This script contains the minimum for generating planet
names.

It also has a simple command-line interface for printing planet names (n)
and for jumping to the next galaxy (j).

I made a simple wrapper script too called `elite.py`. If you want to get
the name of a random planet, use `elite.py`.

Examples
--------

Print the planet names in Galaxy 1:

    import pyplanets

    galaxy = pyplanets.Galaxy()
    print(galaxy.planets)

Print the name of a random planet:

    import random
    ...
    print(random.choice(galaxy.planets))
